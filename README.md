#  Python - Foundations


## Overview & Objective:

* In this workshop we will cover basics of Python and lay foundational knowledge required for the series:
* We'll learn to program the 'pythonic way' and delve into features exclusive to Python.
* The objective is to understand conceptual underpinnings of Python programming while reinforcing this conceptual knowledge with practice exercises and challenges.

We'll work on realistic examples like:

* Parsing log files.
* Playing with publicly available data.
* Scripting basic system administration tasks (Managing file systems and processes).
* Writing scripts to interact with World Wide Web.
* Creating professional/manageable command-line interfaces.
